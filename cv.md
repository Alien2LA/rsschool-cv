Area sales manager

about me

Qualified sales manager with a successful track record for 13+ years. I have a deep experience with the entire sales process, excel at lead generation, relationship building, and deal closing. I have strong negotiating skills and can inspire the same performance in others.

A lifelong learner with a growth mindset. Systematic, team-oriented, with a positive leadership philosophy. I want to find a team of active and interesting people who really care about what they are doing and are ready to move forward despite any obstacles.

I started my career in an international FMCG company. Having reached the position of a Key Account Manager, I decided to move on and got a Customer Service Representative role in the international industrial packaging company Sonoco-Alcore. In 9 years I’ve grown to an Area Sales Manager / Sales Director. Since I have a technical education, I’ve always been interested in the IT sector. So in the beginning of 2022 I’ve started to learn Java. At the moment, I am considering starting a career in the field of information technology in the sales department.
