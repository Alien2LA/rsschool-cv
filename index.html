        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>

        <p>Qualified sales manager with a successful track record for 13+ years. I have a deep experience with the entire
            sales process, excel at lead generation, relationship building, and deal closing. I have strong negotiating
            skills and can inspire the same performance in others.</p>

        <p>A lifelong learner with a growth mindset. Systematic, team-oriented, with a positive leadership philosophy. 
            I want to find a team of active and interesting people who really care about what they are doing and are 
            ready to move forward despite any obstacles.</p>

        <p>I started my career in an international FMCG company. Having reached the position of a Key Account Manager, 
            I decided to move on and got a Customer Service Representative role in the international industrial packaging
            company Sonoco-Alcore. In 9 years I’ve grown to an Area Sales Manager / Sales Director. Since I have a technical 
            education, I’ve always been interested in the IT sector. So in the beginning of 2022 I’ve started to learn Java and JS. 
            At the moment, I am considering starting a career in the field of information technology in the sales department.</p>

    <code class="code">
        <pre>
            public static int taxEarningsMinusSpendings(int earnings, int spendings) {
                int tax = (earnings - spendings) * 15 / 100;
