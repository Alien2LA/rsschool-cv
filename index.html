            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Qualified sales manager with a successful track record for 13+ years. I have a deep experience with the entire
                sales process, excel at lead generation, relationship building, and deal closing. I have strong negotiating
                skills and can inspire the same performance in others.</p>

            <p>A lifelong learner with a growth mindset. Systematic, team-oriented, with a positive leadership philosophy. 
                I want to find a team of active and interesting people who really care about what they are doing and are 
                ready to move forward despite any obstacles.</p>

            <p>I started my career in an international FMCG company. Having reached the position of a Key Account Manager, 
                I decided to move on and got a Customer Service Representative role in the international industrial packaging
                company Sonoco-Alcore. In 9 years I’ve grown to an Area Sales Manager / Sales Director. Since I have a technical 
                education, I’ve always been interested in the IT sector. So in the beginning of 2022 I’ve started to learn Java and JS. 
                At the moment, I am considering starting a career in the field of information technology in the sales department.</p>
